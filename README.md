# IMDB-Movie-Review-Rating-Predictor

In the past year, 2023, movie theaters in the United States and Canada sold over 830 million tickets. Before the start of the pandemic, these numbers were at over 1.2 billion. As a result of the vast numbers of movies being seen, review websites such as IMDB have been bombarded with opinions of sentiment towards these movies. Due to the vast amount of data available from these reviews, we decided that it would be interesting to examine how certain diction, grammar, and other linguistic features can affect a review sentiment. And also how we might use these to our advantage to predict the sentiment of a review. 

This project uses various NLP techniques, including Bag of Words, GloVe, and Word2Vec. We also utilize machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Using these tools, we trained a machine learning model to predict the sentiment of movie reviews accurately.
